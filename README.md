# SwiftUI Kara and Karatext

SwiftUI Kara and Karatext is a set of Polymer web components which are used to display and synchronize lyrics while playing an audio track at background. The source of audio can be a YouTube stream (using [google-youtube](https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-youtube) Polymer component) or an `<audio>` tag.

Text rendering and highlighting effect is done by using [SVG.js](http://svgjs.com/).

## Demo

[Here in my portfolio page](http://zuyetawarmatik.github.io/experiments/swiftui-kara), I'm using the song [Santa Claus Is Coming To Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-kJau6dVs) by Cascada.

## Install

Install the component using [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```sh
$ bower install swiftui-kara --save
```

## Usage

1. Import Web Components' polyfill:

	```html
	<script src="bower_components/platform/platform.js"></script>
	```

2. Import SwiftUI Kara element sets:

	```html
	<link rel="import" href="bower_components/swiftui-kara/swiftui-kara.html">
	```

3. Start using it:

	```html
	<swiftui-kara effect="glow" audioSrcType="audio"
								audioSrc="santa-claus-is-coming-to-town.mp3">
		<swiftui-karatext start="0:0:15" end="0:0:16.6">
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:15" end="0:0:15.4">You'd</swiftui-karaword>
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:15.2" end="0:0:15.8">better</swiftui-karaword>
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:15.6" end="0:0:16">watch</swiftui-karaword>
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:15.8" end="0:0:16.2">out!</swiftui-karaword>
		</swiftui-karatext>
		<swiftui-karatext start="0:0:16.6" end="0:0:18.3">
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:16.8" end="0:0:17.2">You'd</swiftui-karaword>
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:17" end="0:0:17.4">better</swiftui-karaword>
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:17.2" end="0:0:17.6">not</swiftui-karaword>
			<swiftui-karaword start="0:0:17.6" end="0:0:18">cry!</swiftui-karaword>
		</swiftui-karatext>
		...
	</swiftui-kara>
	```

	It's certainly OK if you don't use `<swiftui-karaword>` inside a `<swiftui-karatext>`:

	```html
	<swiftui-kara effect="slide" audioSrcType="audio"
								audioSrc="santa-claus-is-coming-to-town.mp3">
		<swiftui-karatext start="0:0:15" end="0:0:16.6">
			You'd better watch out!
		</swiftui-karatext>
		<swiftui-karatext start="0:0:16.6" end="0:0:18.3">
			You'd better not cry!
		</swiftui-karatext>
		...
	</swiftui-kara>
	```

4. Doing some styling before enjoying it:

	```css
	swiftui-kara {
		height: 40rem;
		width: 100%;

		font-family: "Raleway", sans-serif;
		font-size: 5rem;
		font-weight: bold;
		line-height: 3rem;
	}

	swiftui-karatext {
		color: #FC5956; /* Clipping text color */
		background-color: #444; /* Ground text color */
	}
	```

## Styles

SwiftUI Kara selectors are easily styled by using ordinary CSS, such as font (family, style, weight...), sizing and positioning.

There are a few reserved CSS rules for SwiftUI Kara (and Karatext) which has a different meaning from its original one:

Selector      												| Rules								| Description
---           												| --- 								| ---
`swiftui-kara` or `swiftui-karatext`	| `line-height`				| Space height between the first and second lyrics text line.
`swiftui-kara` 												| `height`						| (Compulsory)
`swiftui-kara` 												| `width`							| (Compulsory)
`swiftui-karatext`										| `background-color`	| Color of the ground (overlaid) text.
`swiftui-karatext`										| `color`							| Color of the clipping (overlaying) text.

## Development on Forking

1. Install prerequisites and local dependencies:

	```sh
	$ [sudo] npm install -g bower grunt-cli
	```

	```sh
	$ bower install && npm install
	```
	
2. Development branch should be forked from `dev` branch.

3. In this project, there is a `pre-release` branch to stage the element before publishing it to `master`.
	
	* If development is deemed to be stable at some stage, merge the latest stable commit from branch `dev` to `pre-release`.

	* On `pre-release` branch, run:

		```sh
		$ grunt build
		```
	to stage the assets.

	* If it's fully tested on `pre-release`, merge `pre-release` to `master`.

## Current Issues

* Timers will be messed up if switching tab.

* YouTube audio source not working in mobile browsers due to the fact that it's not allowed to play YouTube by script on these devices (i.e. `play()`).

* Not handling audio stream pausing due to transferring error.

## Features in Next Versions

* One-line style.
