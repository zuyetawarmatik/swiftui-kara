# SwiftUI Kara and Karatext

Swift UI Kara and Karatext is a set of Polymer web components which are used to display and synchronize lyrics while playing an audio track at background. Currently the source of audio is created by using [google-youtube](https://github.com/GoogleWebComponents/google-youtube) Polymer component.

Text rendering and highlighting effect is done by using [SVG.js](http://svgjs.com/).

## Demo

[Here in my portfolio page](http://zuyetawarmatik.github.io/experiments/swiftui-kara), I'm using the song [Santa Claus Is Coming To Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-kJau6dVs) by Cascada.

## Install

Install the component using [Bower](http://bower.io/):

```sh
$ bower install swiftui-kara --save
```
